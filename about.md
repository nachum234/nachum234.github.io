My name is Yossi and I like to workout at the gym on my free time : )

On my professional life I'm a DevOps engineer and I love to work with new technologies.

I have experience with the following:
* AWS
* Google cloud
* Kubernetes
* Python
* Chef
* Prometheus
* Sensu
* Terraform
* Grafana
* Elastic
* and more ...

I love to build new environments on the cloud, and take
responsibility on growing live production systems, by monitoring
identify bottlenecks and solving them.

My email is nachum234@gmail.com
